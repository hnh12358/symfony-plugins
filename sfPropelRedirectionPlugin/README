sfPropelRedirectionPlugin is an extension to Symfony that allows the programmer
to use an alternate database connection on read operations under certain conditions
if they are specified. The above is a commented example of an app.yml that contains
configuration options to the plugin:

all:
  redirection:
    databases:
      #Identifier for the database at the databases.yml
      propel:
        slaves:
          #The slaves identifiers has not special usage.
          slave1:
            dsn:        mysql:dbname=sayeet_repl;host=localhost
            username:   symfony
            password:   symfony
          slave2:
            dsn:        mysql:dbname=sayeet_repl;host=localhost
            username:   symfony
            password:   symfony
        #Entitied that may can be read from the slave servers
        entities:
          Message:
            #Column that indicates the "age" of a record.
            gen_column: posted_at
            #Conditions dictates when is safe to read from the slave servers, just one is needed.
            #The ctx indicates the module/action pair on wich is valid to read from slaves
            #added enforces a check over the criteria object to ensure that the records
            #seeked are "old" enough to be at the slave servers, added has the form of
            #{s: seconds, m: minutes, h: hours, D: days, M: months, Y: years}
            conditions: [{ctx: stats/index,added:{m: 30}},{ctx: board/index,added:{h: 1}}]
          #No conditions or any emtpy condition means to ALWAYS read from the slaves.
          Topic:
            conditions: []
          Student:
            conditions: [{ctx: people/index},{}]

Take into account that for the *added* component of conditions to be
considered the following need to apply:

1) A valid gen_column is provided.
2) The criteria object involves the use of the gen_column.
3) The comparison on the criteria object is <, <= or ==.

Any other variant uses the default connection.

If you need to get a connection to slave servers bypassing the conditions look
at the next code:

    $con = sfPropelRedirection::getConnectionToSlave(MessagePeer::DATABASE_NAME);
    $sql = "SELECT customer.name, customer.id, COUNT(order.num) AS num_ord
            FROM customer INNER JOIN order ON customers.cust_id = orders.cust_id
            GROUP BY customers.cust_id;";
    $stm = $con->createStatement();
    $rs = $stm->executeQuery($sql, ResultSet::FETCHMODE_NUM);
